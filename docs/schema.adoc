To retrieve indexes and constraints information for all the node labels in your database, you can use the following procedure:

```cypher
CALL apoc.schema.nodes() yield name, label, properties, status, type
```

Where the outputs are:

  * name of the index/constraint,
  * label
  * properties, (for Neo4j 3.1 and lower versions is a single element array) that are affected by the constraint
  * status, for index can be one of the following values: ONLINE, POPULATING and FAILED
  * type, always "INDEX" for indexes, constraint type for constraints
  * failure, the failure description of a failed index
  * populationProgress, the population progress of the index in percentage
  * size, the size of the index
  * valuesSelectivity, computes the selectivity of the unique values
  * userDescription, a user friendly description of what this index indexes

To retrieve the constraint information for all the relationship types in your database, you can use the following procedure:

```cypher
CALL apoc.schema.relationships() yield name, type, properties, status
```

Where the outputs are:

  * name of the constraint
  * type of the relationship
  * properties, (for Neo4j 3.1 and lower versions is a single element array) that are affected by the constraint
  * status

N.B. Constraints for property existence on nodes and relationships are available only for the Enterprise Edition.

=== Examples

===== List indexes and constraints for nodes

Given the following cypher statements:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (bar:Bar) ASSERT exists(bar.foobar)
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON (bar:Bar) ASSERT bar.foo IS UNIQUE
CREATE INDEX ON :Person(name)
CREATE INDEX ON :Publication(name)
CREATE INDEX ON :Source(name)
```

When you

```cypher
CALL apoc.schema.nodes()
```

you will receive this result:

image::{img}/apoc.schema.nodes.png[]

===== List constraints for relationships

Given the following cypher statements:

```cypher
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON ()-[like:LIKED]-() ASSERT exists(like.day)
CREATE CONSTRAINT ON ()-[starred:STARRED]-() ASSERT exists(starred.month)
```

When you

```cypher
CALL apoc.schema.relationships()
```

you will receive this result:

image::{img}/apoc.schema.relationships.png[]

==== Check if an index or a constraint exists for a Label and property

Given the previous index definitions, running this statement:

```cypher
RETURN apoc.schema.node.indexExists("Publication", ["name"])
```
produces the following output:

image::{img}/apoc.schema.node.indexExists.png[]


Given the previous constraint definitions, running this statement:

```cypher
RETURN apoc.schema.node.constraintExists("Bar", ["foobar"])
```
produces the following output:

image::{img}/apoc.schema.node.constraintExists.png[]

If you want to check if a constraint exists for a relationship you can run this statement:

```cypher
RETURN apoc.schema.relationship.constraintExists('LIKED', ['day'])
```

and you get the following result:

image:{img}/apoc.schema.relationship.constraintExists.png[]

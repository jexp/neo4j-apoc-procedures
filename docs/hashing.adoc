= Hashing

The following functions do calculate hashsums over nodes, relationship or the entire graph. It takes into account all
properties, node labels and relationship types.

The hashsum of a graph first calculates the hashsums for each node. This hashsum list is ordered and for each node the
hashsum for all relationships and their endnode are added. This approach provides independence of internal ids.

Optionally you can supply a list of `propertyKeys` that should be ignored on all nodes. This is, e.g. useful if you store
`created=timestamp()` properties that should be ignored.

Cypher is great for querying graphs and importing and updating graph structures.
While during imports you can use `PERIODIC COMMIT` to control transaction sizes in memory, but for other graph refactorings it's not that easy to commit transactions regularly to free memory for new update state.

This section includes:

* <<commit-batching>>
* <<periodic-commit>>
* <<periodic-countdown>>

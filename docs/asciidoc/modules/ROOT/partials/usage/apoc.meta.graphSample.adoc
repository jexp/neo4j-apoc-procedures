In some cases this procedure will show extra relationships, because is based on database statistics.
For example:
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (a:S1 {SomeName1:'aaa'})
CREATE (b:S2 {SomeName2:'bbb'})
CREATE (c:S3 {SomeName3:'ccc'})
CREATE (a)-[:HAS]->(b)
CREATE (b)-[:HAS]->(c)

[source,cypher]

CALL apoc.meta.graphSample()

generate the following graph:

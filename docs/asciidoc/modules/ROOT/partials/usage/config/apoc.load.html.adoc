The procedure support the following config parameters:

.Config parameters
[opts="header",cols="1m,2m,1m,4"]
|===
| name | type | default | description
| withBrowser | Enum [NONE, CHROME, FIREFOX] | NONE | If it is set to "CRHOME" or "FIREFOX", is used https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/[Selenium Web Driver] to read the dynamically generated js.
    In case it is "NONE" (default), it is not possible to read dynamic contents.
    Note that to use the chrome or firefox driver, you need to have them installed on your machine.
| charset | String | "UTF-8" | the character set of the page being scraped, if `http-equiv` meta-tag is not set. In case the config `withBrowser` is not `NONE`, the implicit auto-detection encoding in the browser is used, so this property is ignored.
| baseUri | String | "" | Base URI used to resolve relative paths
| failSilently | Enum [FALSE, WITH_LOG, WITH_LIST] | FALSE | If the parse fails with one or more elements, using `FALSE` it throws a `RuntimeException`, using `WITH_LOG` a `log.warn` is created for each incorrect item and using `WITH_LIST` an `errorList` key is added to the result with the failed tags.

= Collapse node to relationship

[abstract]
--
This section describes a procedure that can be used to collapse a node into a relationship.
--

The available procedure is described in the table below:

[cols="1m,5"]
|===
| call apoc.refactor.collapseNode([node1,node2],'TYPE') | collapse nodes with 2 rels to relationship, node with one rel becomes self-relationship
|===

== Example Usage

The example below will help us learn how to use this procedure.

.The following creates a graph containing a `Flight` and origin and destination `Airport`s:
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (flight:Flight {number: "BA001"})
CREATE (origin:Airport {code: "LHR"})
CREATE (destination:Airport {code: "AMS"})
CREATE (flight)<-[:OUT]-(origin)
CREATE (flight)-[:IN]->(destination)
----

.The following query collapses the `Flight` node, replacing it with a `CONNECTED` to relationship:
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (flight:Flight {number: "BA001"})
CALL apoc.refactor.collapseNode([flight],'CONNECTED_TO')
YIELD input, output , error
RETURN input, output, error
----

If we execute this query, it will result in the following graph:

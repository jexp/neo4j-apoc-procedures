[abstract]
--
This section describes procedures that can be used to redirect relationships from source or target nodes.
--

The available procedures are described in the table below:

[cols="1m,5"]
|===
| call apoc.refactor.to(rel, endNode) | redirect relationship to use new end-node
| call apoc.refactor.from(rel, startNode) | redirect relationship to use new start-node
|===

== Example Usage

The examples below will help us learn how to use these procedures.

=== Redirect Target Node

.The following creates Foo and Bar nodes that are connected by a `FOOBAR` relationship, as well as a solitary Antony node:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (f:Foo {value: "Foo"})-[rel:FOOBAR {a:1}]->(b:Bar {value: "Bar"})
CREATE (p:Person {name:'Antony'})
RETURN *
----

image::apoc.refactor.to.dataset.png[]

.The following will change the target node of the `FOOBAR` relationship from the Bar node to the Antony node:
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (f:Foo)-[rel:FOOBAR {a:1}]->(b:Bar)
MATCH (p:Person {name:'Antony'})
CALL apoc.refactor.to(rel, p)
YIELD input, output
RETURN input, output
----

If we execute this query, it will result in the following graph:

image::apoc.refactor.to.png[]

=== Redirect Source Node

.The following creates Foo2 and Bar2 nodes that are connected by a `FOOBAR2` relationship, as well as a solitary David node:
[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (f:Foo2 {value: "Foo2"})-[rel:FOOBAR2 {a:1}]->(b:Bar2 {value: "Bar2"})
CREATE (p:Person {name:'David'})
RETURN *
----

image::apoc.refactor.from.dataset.png[]

.The following will change the source node of the `FOOBAR2` relationship from the Foo node to the David node:
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (f:Foo2)-[rel:FOOBAR2 {a:1}]->(b:Bar2)
MATCH (p:Person {name:'David'})
CALL apoc.refactor.from(rel, p)
YIELD input, output
RETURN input, output
----

If we execute this query, it will result in the following graph:

image::apoc.refactor.from.png[]

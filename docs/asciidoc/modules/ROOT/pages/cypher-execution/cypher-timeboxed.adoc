= Timeboxed Cypher statements
:description: This chapter describes a procedure in the APOC library that can be used to timebox Cypher statements.



There's a way to terminate a cypher statement if it takes longer than a given threshold. Consider an expensive statement calculating cross product of shortestpaths for each pair of nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.cypher.runTimeboxed(
  "match (n),(m) match p=shortestPath((n)-[*]-(m)) return p",
  null,
  10000
)
YIELD value
RETURN value.p
----

This will return all results computed within 10000 milliseconds.
The statement will be terminated after that period.

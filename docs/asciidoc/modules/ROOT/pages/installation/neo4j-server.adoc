== Manual Installation: Download latest release

// tag::install[]

Since APOC relies on Neo4j's internal APIs you need to use the *matching APOC version* for your Neo4j installaton.
Make sure that the *first two version numbers match between Neo4j and APOC*.

Go to http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/{apoc-release}[the latest release] for *Neo4j version {branch}* and download the binary jar to place into your `$NEO4J_HOME/plugins` folder.

You can find http://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases/[all releases here].

This chapter describes procedures that wrap Amazon Web Services Comprehend Natural Language API.
--

Amazon Web Services (AWS) https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/index.html[Comprehend Natural Language API^] uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in text.
The procedures in this chapter act as a wrapper around calls to this API to extract entities from text stored as node properties.

Each procedure has two modes:

* Stream - returns a map constructed from the JSON returned from the API
* Graph - creates a graph or virtual graph based on the values returned by the API

This section includes the following:

* <<nlp-aws-java-sdk>>
* <<nlp-aws-api-key>>
* <<nlp-aws-entities>>
* <<nlp-aws-examples>>

[[nlp-aws-java-sdk]]
==== Install AWS Java SDK For Amazon Comprehend

The AWS NLP procedures are compiled against version _1.11.163_ of the https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.amazonaws/aws-java-sdk-comprehend[AWS Java SDK For Amazon Comprehend^] library, which is not included in the APOC Library.
To use the library we'll need to download the following jar files and place them in the `plugins` directory:

[verse]
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/amazonaws/aws-java-sdk-comprehend/1.11.683/aws-java-sdk-comprehend-1.11.683.jar[aws-java-sdk-comprehend-1.11.683.jar^]
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/amazonaws/aws-java-sdk-core/1.11.683/aws-java-sdk-core-1.11.683.jar[aws-java-sdk-core-1.11.683.jar^]
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/httpcomponents/httpclient/4.5.9/httpclient-4.5.9.jar[httpclient-4.5.9.jar^]
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/httpcomponents/httpcore/4.4.11/httpcore-4.4.11.jar[httpcore-4.4.11.jar^]
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/joda-time/joda-time/2.8.1/joda-time-2.8.1.jar[joda-time-2.8.1.jar^]

Once we've done this we'll need to restart the Neo4j server.

[[nlp-aws-api-key]]
==== Setting up API Key and Secret

We can generate an Access Key and Secret by following the instructions at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html^].
Once we've done that, we can populate and execute the following commands to create parameters that contains these details.

.The following define the `apiKey` and `apiSecret` parameters
[source,cypher]
----
:param apiKey => ("<api-key-here>");
:param apiSecret => ("<api-secret-here>");
----

[[nlp-aws-entities]]
==== Entity Extraction

The entity extraction procedures (`apoc.nlp.aws.entities.*`) are wrappers around the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/comprehend/latest/dg/how-entities.html[Detect Entities^] operations of the AWS Comprehend Natural Language API.
This API method finds entities in the text, which are defined as a textual reference to the unique name of a real-world object such as people, places, and commercial items, and to precise references to measures such as dates and quantities.

The procedures are described below:

[separator=¦,opts=header,cols="1,1m,1m,5"]
|===
include::../../../build/generated-documentation/apoc.nlp.aws.entities.csv[]
|===

The procedures support the following config parameters:

.Config parameters
[opts=header]
|===
| name | type | default | description
| key | String | null | AWS Access Control Key
| secret | String | null | AWS Access Control Secret
| nodeProperty | String | text | The property on the provided node that contains the unstructured text to be analyzed
|===

In addition, `apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph` supports the following config parameters:

.Config parameters
[opts=header]
|===
| name | type | default | description
| write | Boolean | false | persist the graph of entities
| relationshipType | String | ENTITY | relationship type for relationships from source node to entity nodes
|===

.Streaming mode
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.stream(source:Node or List<Node>, {
  key: String,
  secret: String,
  nodeProperty: String
})
YIELD value
----

.Graph mode
[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(source:Node or List<Node>, {
  key: String,
  secret: String,
  nodeProperty: String,
  relationshipType: String,
  write: Boolean
})
YIELD graph

[[nlp-aws-examples]]
==== Examples

The examples in this section are based on the following sample graph:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (:Article {
 uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/",
 body: "These days I’m rarely more than a few feet away from my Nintendo Switch and I play board games, card games and role playing games with friends at least once or twice a week. I’ve even organised lunch-time Mario Kart 8 tournaments between the Neo4j European offices!"
});

CREATE (:Article {
 uri: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Switch",
 body: "The Nintendo Switch is a video game console developed by Nintendo, released worldwide in most regions on March 3, 2017. It is a hybrid console that can be used as a home console and portable device. The Nintendo Switch was unveiled on October 20, 2016. Nintendo offers a Joy-Con Wheel, a small steering wheel-like unit that a Joy-Con can slot into, allowing it to be used for racing games such as Mario Kart 8."
});
----

[[nlp-aws-examples-entities]]
===== Entity Extraction

Let's start by extracting the entities from the Article node.
The text that we want to analyze is stored in the `body` property of the node, so we'll need to specify that via the `nodeProperty` configuration parameter.

.The following streams the entities for the Pokemon article
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.stream(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body"
})
YIELD value
UNWIND value.entities AS entity
RETURN entity;
----

.Results
[opts="header"]

| entity

We get back 7 different entities.
We could then apply a Cypher statement that creates one node per entity and an `ENTITY` relationship from each of those nodes back to the `Article` node.

.The following streams the entities for the Pokemon article and then creates nodes for each entity
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.stream(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body"
})
YIELD value
UNWIND value.entities AS entity
MERGE (e:Entity {name: entity.text})
SET e.type = entity.type
MERGE (a)-[:ENTITY]->(e)
----

Alternatively we can use the graph mode to automatically create the entity graph.
As well as having the `Entity` label, each entity node will have another label based on the value of the `type` property.
By default a virtual graph is returned.

.The following returns a virtual graph of entities for the Pokemon article
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article {uri: "https://neo4j.com/blog/pokegraph-gotta-graph-em-all/"})
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(a, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  relationshipType: "ENTITY"
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;
----

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph.svg>>.

[[apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph.svg]]
image::apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph.svg[title="Pokemon entities graph"]

We can compute the entities for multiple nodes by passing a list of nodes to the procedure.

.The following returns a virtual graph of entities for the Pokemon and Nintendo Switch articles
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)
WITH collect(a) AS articles
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(articles, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  relationshipType: "ENTITY"
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g
----

We can see a Neo4j Browser visualization of the virtual graph in <<apoc.nlp.aws.entities-multiple.graph.svg>>.

[[apoc.nlp.aws.entities-multiple.graph.svg]]
image::apoc.nlp.aws.entities-multiple.graph.svg[title="Pokemon and Nintendo Switch entities graph"]



If we're happy with this graph and would like to persist it in Neo4j, we can do this by specifying the `write: true` configuration.

.The following creates a `HAS_ENTITY` relationship from the article to each entity
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Article)
WITH collect(a) AS articles
CALL apoc.nlp.aws.entities.graph(articles, {
  key: $apiKey,
  secret: $apiSecret,
  nodeProperty: "body",
  relationshipType: "HAS_ENTITY",
  write: true
})
YIELD graph AS g
RETURN g;
----

We can then write a query to return the entities that have been created.

.The following returns articles and their entities
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (article:Article)
RETURN article.uri AS article,
       [(article)-[:HAS_ENTITY]->(e) | e.text] AS entities;
----

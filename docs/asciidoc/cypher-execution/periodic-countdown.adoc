[abstract]

This section describes a procedure that can be used to run a query repeatedly until a termination condition is reached.
--

Repeats a statement until the termination is reached. The statement must return a numeric value and it should decrement (like a monotonically decreasing function). When the return value reaches 0 than the iteration stops.
For example, define a counter with a numeric property:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (counter:Counter) SET counter.c = 10
----

and decrement this property by 1 each second:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.periodic.countdown('decrement',"MATCH (counter:Counter) SET counter.c = counter.c - 1 RETURN counter.c as count", 1)
----

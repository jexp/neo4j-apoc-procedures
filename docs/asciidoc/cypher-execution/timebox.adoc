= Timeboxing Cypher statements

[abstract]
--
This chapter describes a procedure in the APOC library that can be used to timebox Cypher statements.
--

There's a way to terminate a cypher statement if it takes longer than a given threshold. Consider an expensive statement calculating cross product of shortestpaths for each pair of nodes:

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.cypher.runTimeboxed("match (n),(m) match p=shortestPath((n)-[*]-(m)) return p", null, 10000)
yield value
return value.p
----

This will return all results being returned within 10000 milliseconds. The expensive statement will be terminated after that period.

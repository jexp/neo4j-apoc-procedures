[[run-cypher-scripts]]
= Run Cypher Script Files

Runs each statement in the file / each file, all semicolon separated

You can use them with files that are usually run by cypher-shell or neo4j-shell, e.g. generated by `apoc.export.cypher.*`
They automatically skip `:begin/:commit/:rollback` operations as they are executed in a single transaction per file.

Data Operations only:

* `apoc.cypher.runFile(file or url,[{config}])`
* `apoc.cypher.runFiles([files or urls],[{config})])`

Schema Operations only:

* `apoc.cypher.runSchemaFile(file or url,[{config}])`
* `apoc.cypher.runSchemaFiles([files or urls],[{config})])`

The `apoc.cypher.run*File(s)` procedures have some optional configuration:

* `{statistics:true/false}` to output a row of update-stats per statement, default is true
* `{timeout:1 or 10}` for how long the stream waits for new data, default is 10

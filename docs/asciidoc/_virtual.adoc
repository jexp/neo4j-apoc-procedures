== Virtual Nodes & Relationships (Graph Projections)

[abstract]
--
This chapter describes virtual node and relationship procedures in the APOC library.

Virtual Nodes and Relationships don't exist in the graph, they are only returned to the UI/user for representing a graph projection.
They can be visualized or processed otherwise.
Please note that they have negative id's.

For more information on how to use these procedures, see:

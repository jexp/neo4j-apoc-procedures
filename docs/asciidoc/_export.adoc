This chapter describes procedures in the APOC library that can be used to export data from Neo4j.

The APOC library adds support for exporting data into various data formats, including JSON, CSV, and Cypher script.

[NOTE]
In case you have the default configuration with `apoc.import.file.use_neo4j_config=true` the export consider as root the directory defined into the `dbms.directories.import` property

For more information on how to use these procedures, see:

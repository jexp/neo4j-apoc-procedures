| apoc.schema.assert({indexLabel:[indexKeys],...},{constraintLabel:[constraintKeys],...}, dropExisting : true) yield label, key, unique, action | drops all other existing indexes and constraints when `dropExisting` is `true` (default is `true`), and asserts that at the end of the operation the given indexes and unique constraints are there, each label:key pair is considered one constraint/label.
| apoc.schema.nodes([config]) yield name, label, properties, status, type | get all indexes and constraints information for all the node labels in your database, in optional config param could be define a set of labels to include or exclude
| apoc.schema.relationships([config]) yield name, type, properties, status | return all the constraint information for all the relationship types in your database, in optional config param could be define a set of types to include or exclude
| apoc.schema.node.constraintExists(labelName, properties) | return the constraints existence on node
| apoc.schema.relationship.constraintExists(type, properties) | return the constraints existence on relationship

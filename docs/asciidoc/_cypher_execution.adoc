| CALL apoc.cypher.run(fragment, params) yield value | executes reading fragment with the given parameters
| apoc.cypher.runFirstColumnSingle(statement, params) | function that executes statement with given parameters returning first column only, will return first/single row or null
| apoc.cypher.runFirstColumnMany(statement, params) | function that executes statement with given parameters returning first column only, will collect all rows into a list
| CALL apoc.cypher.runFile(file or url,{config}) yield row, result | runs each statement in the file, all semicolon separated - currently no schema operations
| CALL apoc.cypher.runFiles([files or urls],{config}) yield row, result | runs each statement in the files, all semicolon separated
| CALL apoc.cypher.runSchemaFile(file or url,{config}) - allows only schema operations, runs each schema statement in the file, all semicolon separated
| CALL apoc.cypher.runSchemaFiles([files or urls],{config}) - allows only schema operations, runs each schema statement in the files, all semicolon separated
| CALL apoc.cypher.runMany('cypher;\nstatements;',{params},{config}) | runs each semicolon separated statement and returns summary - currently no schema operations
| CALL apoc.cypher.mapParallel(fragment, params, list-to-parallelize) yield value | executes fragment in parallel batches with the list segments being assigned to _
| CALL apoc.cypher.doIt(fragment, params) yield value | executes writing fragment with the given parameters
| CALL apoc.cypher.runTimeboxed('cypherStatement',{params}, timeout) | abort statement after timeout millis if not finished

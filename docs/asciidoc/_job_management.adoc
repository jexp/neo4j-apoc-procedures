== Background Operations

[abstract]

This chapter describes procedures that can be used to schedule execution of Cypher statements to run in the background.
--

Sometimes you want to schedule execution of Cypher statements to run regularly in the background or asynchronously ("fire & forget").
This can also be useful in cloud environments that limit the runtime of statements (e.g. to 2 or 5 minutes) by scheduling execution in the background.

The `apoc.periodic.*` procedures provide such capabilities.

While label filters use labels to allow whitelisting, blacklisting, and restrictions on which kind of nodes can end or terminate expansion,
you can also filter based upon actual nodes.

Each of these config parameter accepts a list of nodes, or a list of node ids.

| config parameter | description | added in
| endNodes | Only these nodes can end returned paths, and expansion will continue past these nodes, if possible. | Winter 2018 APOC releases.
| terminatorNodes | Only these nodes can end returned paths, and expansion won't continue past these nodes. | Winter 2018 APOC releases.
| whitelistNodes | Only these nodes are allowed in the expansion (though endNodes and terminatorNodes will also be allowed, if present). | Spring 2018 APOC releases.
| blacklistNodes | None of the paths returned will include these nodes. | Spring 2018 APOC releases.

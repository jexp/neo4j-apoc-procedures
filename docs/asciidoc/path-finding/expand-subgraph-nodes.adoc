== Expand to nodes in a subgraph

[abstract]
--
This section describes a procedure that expands a subgraph from a set of start nodes, and returns all nodes within the subgraph.
--

This procedure expands to subgraph nodes reachable from the start node following relationships to max-level adhering to the label filters.
It allows fine grained control over the traversals that expand the subgraph.

=== Examples


Expand to all nodes of a connected subgraph:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (user:User) WHERE user.id = 460
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(user, {}) YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

Expand to all nodes reachable by :FRIEND relationships:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (user:User) WHERE user.id = 460
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(user, {relationshipFilter:'FRIEND'}) YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

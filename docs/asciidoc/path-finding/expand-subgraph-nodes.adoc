== Expand to nodes in a subgraph

[abstract]
--
This section describes a procedure that expands a subgraph from a set of start nodes, and returns all nodes within the subgraph.
--

----
apoc.path.subgraphNodes(startNode <id>Node/list, {maxLevel, relationshipFilter, labelFilter, bfs:true, filterStartNode:true, limit:-1, optional:false}) yield node
----

Expand to subgraph nodes reachable from the start node following relationships to max-level adhering to the label filters.

Accepts the same `config` values as in `expandConfig()`, though `uniqueness` is not configurable and `minLevel`, if present, must be 0 or 1 if present.

.Examples

Expand to all nodes of a connected subgraph:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (user:User) WHERE user.id = 460
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(user, {}) YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

Expand to all nodes reachable by :FRIEND relationships:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (user:User) WHERE user.id = 460
CALL apoc.path.subgraphNodes(user, {relationshipFilter:'FRIEND'}) YIELD node
RETURN node;
----

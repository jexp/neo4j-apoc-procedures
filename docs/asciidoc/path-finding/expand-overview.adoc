== Path Expander Overview

[abstract]
--
This section describes procedures that can be used to do variable length path traversals.
--

The Path Expander procedures enable powerful variable length path traversals, where users can specify the following:

* the direction of the relationship per relationship type.
* a list of label names which act as a "whitelist" or a "blacklist".
* end nodes for the expansion.

This functionality is supported by five procedures:

[options="header"]
|===
| Procedure | Description | Documentation
|  `apoc.path.expand()` | expands paths using Cypher's default expansion modes (bfs and 'RELATIONSHIP_PATH' uniqueness).  | <<path-expander-paths>>
| `apoc.path.expandConfig()`  | allows more flexible configuration of parameters and expansion modes. | <<path-expander-paths-config>>
|`apoc.path.subgraphNodes()` | expands to nodes of a subgraph. | <<expand-subgraph-nodes>>
| `apoc.path.subgraphAll()` | expands to nodes of a subgraph and also returns all relationships in the subgraph. | <<expand-subgraph>>
| `apoc.path.spanningTree()` | expands to paths collectively forming a spanning tree. | <<expand-spanning-tree>>

See <<path-expander-all-config>> for a detailed explanation of the configuration supported by these procedures.

//[[path-expander-available]]
//=== Available Procedures
//
//The available procedures are described below:
//
//[cols="1m,5"]
//|===
//| call apoc.path.expand(startNode <id>\|Node, relationshipFilter, labelFilter, minDepth, maxDepth ) yield path as <identifier> | expand from given nodes(s) taking the provided restrictions into account
//|===
//
//Variations allow more configurable expansions, and expansions for more specific use cases:
//
//[cols="1m,5"]
//|===
//| call apoc.path.expandConfig(startNode <id>Node/list, {minLevel, maxLevel, relationshipFilter, labelFilter, bfs:true, uniqueness:'RELATIONSHIP_PATH', filterStartNode:true, limit, optional:false, endNodes, terminatorNodes, sequence, beginSequenceAtStart:true}) yield path | expand from given nodes(s) taking the provided restrictions into account
//| call apoc.path.subgraphNodes(startNode <id>Node/list, {minLevel, maxLevel, relationshipFilter, labelFilter, bfs:true, filterStartNode:true, limit, optional:false, endNodes, terminatorNodes, sequence, beginSequenceAtStart:true}) yield node | expand a subgraph from given nodes(s) taking the provided restrictions into account; returns all nodes in the subgraph
//| call apoc.path.subgraphAll(startNode <id>Node/list, {minLevel, maxLevel, relationshipFilter, labelFilter, bfs:true, filterStartNode:true, limit, endNodes, terminatorNodes, sequence, beginSequenceAtStart:true}) yield nodes, relationships | expand a subgraph from given nodes(s) taking the provided restrictions into account; returns the collection of subgraph nodes, and the collection of all relationships within the subgraph
//| call apoc.path.spanningTree(startNode <id>Node/list, {minLevel, maxLevel, relationshipFilter, labelFilter, bfs:true, filterStartNode:true, limit, optional:false, endNodes, terminatorNodes, sequence, beginSequenceAtStart:true}) yield path | expand a spanning tree from given nodes(s) taking the provided restrictions into account; the paths returned collectively form a spanning tree

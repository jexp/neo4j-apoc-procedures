| apoc.neighbors.tohop(node, rel-direction-pattern, distance) | returns distinct nodes of the given relationships in the pattern up to a certain distance
| apoc.neighbors.tohop.count(node, rel-direction-pattern, distance) | returns the count of distinct nodes of the given relationships in the pattern up to a certain distance
| apoc.neighbors.byhop(node, rel-direction-pattern, distance) | returns distinct nodes of the given relationships in the pattern grouped by distance
| apoc.neighbors.byhop.count(node, rel-direction-pattern, distance) | returns the count distinct nodes of the given relationships in the pattern grouped by distance
| apoc.neighbors.athop(node, rel-direction-pattern, distance) | returns distinct nodes of the given relationships in the pattern at a certain distance
| apoc.neighbors.athop.count(node, rel-direction-pattern, distance) | returns the count of distinct nodes of the given relationships in the pattern at a certain distance

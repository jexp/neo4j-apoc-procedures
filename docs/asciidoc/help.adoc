This chapter describes the built in help in the APOC library.

The APOC library ships with the `apoc.help` procedure, which can be used for procedure and function discovery.

Running `call apoc.help('keyword')` will lists all procedures and functions that have the keyword in their name.
If no keyword is provided, it will return a list of all APOC procedures and functions, along with their signatures and descriptions.


If you use `RETURN apoc.version()` it displays the current APOC version.

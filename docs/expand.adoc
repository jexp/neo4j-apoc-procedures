== Usage

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.path.expand(startNode <id>|Node, relationshipFilter, labelFilter, minLevel, maxLevel )

CALL apoc.path.expand(startNode <id>|Node|list, 'TYPE|TYPE_OUT>|<TYPE_IN', '+YesLabel|-NoLabel', minLevel, maxLevel ) yield path
----

== Examples

[source,cypher]
----
call apoc.path.expand(1,"ACTED_IN>|PRODUCED<|FOLLOWS<","+Movie|Person",0,3)
call apoc.path.expand(1,"ACTED_IN>|PRODUCED<|FOLLOWS<","-BigBrother",0,3)
call apoc.path.expand(1,"ACTED_IN>|PRODUCED<|FOLLOWS<","",0,3)

// combined with cypher:

match (tom:Person {name :"Tom Hanks"})
call apoc.path.expand(tom,"ACTED_IN>|PRODUCED<|FOLLOWS<","+Movie|Person",0,3) yield path as pp
return pp;

// or

match (p:Person) with p limit 3
call apoc.path.expand(p,"ACTED_IN>|PRODUCED<|FOLLOWS<","+Movie|Person",1,2) yield path as pp
return p, pp

Apoc optionally allows you to run a cypher command after database initialization is finished. This can e.g. be used to ensure indexes/constraints are created up front.

To use this feature use a config option:

[source,config]
----
apoc.initializer.cypher=CALL apoc.cypher.runSchemaFile("file:///indexes.cypher")
----

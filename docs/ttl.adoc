== TimeToLive (TTL) - Expire Nodes


Some nodes are not meant to live forever.
That's why with APOC you can specify a time by when they are removed from the database, by utilizing a schema index and an additional label.
A few convenience procedures help with that.

Enable cleanup of expired nodes in `neo4j.conf` with `apoc.ttl.enabled=true`

30s after startup an index is created:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE INDEX ON :TTL(ttl)
----

At startup a statement is scheduled to run every 60s (or configure in `neo4j.conf` -  `apoc.ttl.schedule=120`)

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (t:TTL) where t.ttl < timestamp() WITH t LIMIT 1000 DETACH DELETE t
----

The `ttl` property holds the *time when the node is expired in milliseconds since epoch*.

You can expire your nodes by setting the :TTL label and the ttl property:


[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (n:Foo) WHERE n.bar SET n:TTL, n.ttl = timestamp() + 10000;
----

There is also a procedure that does the same:

[source,cypher]
----
CALL apoc.date.expire(node,time,'time-unit');
CALL apoc.date.expire(n,100,'s');
----
